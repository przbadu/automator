# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-15)

**Core value:** The agent can explore the knowledge base the same way Claude Code explores codebases
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Data Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Data Foundation)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-15 -- Completed 01-01-PLAN.md (Schema migration, content storage, FTS5)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Data Foundation | 1 | 12min | 12min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 12min
- Trend: Starting

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01-data-foundation P02 | 4min | 2 tasks | 4 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Keep folders as logical SQLite-only concept -- flat filesystem layout preserved (uploads/{user_id}/{document_id}/{filename})
- [Roadmap]: Do NOT store folder paths in ChromaDB -- resolve via SQLite join to avoid consistency drift
- [Roadmap]: Create FTS5 virtual table in Phase 1 migration upfront, wire into grep only if regex performance is insufficient
- [01-01]: Used ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE (not INSERT OR REPLACE) for document_content upsert to preserve FTS5 rowid mapping
- [01-01]: Used ON DELETE SET NULL for folder_id FK so deleting a folder makes documents unfiled rather than deleted
- [01-01]: Added content/search endpoints in Plan 01 since Phase 3 tools will need them
- [Phase 01-02]: Used ChromaDB chunk reconstruction as fallback when source files missing on disk
- [Phase 01-02]: Process backfill documents sequentially to avoid Docling memory issues

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: Backfill strategy for existing documents needs decision -- re-extract via Docling or reconstruct from chunks
- [Phase 5]: React tree component -- evaluate shadcn/ui availability or build custom recursive component
